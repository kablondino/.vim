# Vim files
This repository tracks and applies the different plugins and custom files for my configuration.
These include the color scheme `swagdino.vim` and the Python and TeX files.

Plugins are managed as git submodules.
Plugins are stored in `./pack/all_plugins/start/` and `./pack/all_plugins/opt/`, in which the ones in `start` load automatically.
Any plugins in `opt` need the `:packadd` command invoked in a vim session.

A good guide for how these work can be found at this [link](https://begriffs.com/posts/2019-07-19-history-use-vim.html?hn=3) in the "Third-party plugins".
